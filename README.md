# Final_Year_Project
A repository for my final year project code, which will follow my design of a Packet Sniffer with Threat Detection.
## Features
- **Live Packet Capture**  
  Capture network packets in real time using Scapy.  
- **Threat Detection Ruleset**  
  Rule-based identification of suspicious packets (e.g. ARP spoofing, DoS patterns, odd TCP flags, anomalous sizes/frequencies).  
- **GUI Interface**  
  Intuitive Tkinter GUI with controls to start/stop capture, filter/sort flows, and view packet details in a pop-up window.  
- **Save & Export**
  Export captured sessions to PCAP for offline analysis or analysis using a different program.  
- **MAC Vendor Lookup**  
  Automatically resolve MAC addresses to manufacturers.

## Instalation and Useage
- **Clone the repository**
- **Install dependancies**  
  scapy  
  tkinter  
  mac_vendor_lookup  
- **Run FULL WORKING BUILD.py**  
  The application GUI will start up in a window and you may use it as necessary, provided you have the correct permissions from the network administrator.
